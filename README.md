# React Portfolio

## Description 

This is my professional portfolio, buit with React and deployed to Heroku. It contains an about page with a brief introduction and pictures of me, a portfolio section with descriptions of and links to some of my work, a contact page with links to my social media and ways to contact me, and a resume page with images of my resume and buttons to download copies of my resume.

## Future Development

I'd like to add more styling to these pages, a footer bar, and a sticky sidebar.

## Biggest Hurdle

Styling with a modularized react website proved to be quite challenging. I'm still working on applying a background to all aspects of the pages. (STAR later)
